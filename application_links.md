To access the application, you need to first start both the backend and frontend servers as described in the `deployment_instructions.md` file.

Once both servers are running, you can open the application in your web browser using the following link:

Frontend (React app): `http://localhost:5173`

The backend API will be running at: `http://localhost:3000`
