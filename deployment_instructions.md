Here are the deployment instructions:

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Navigate to the `server` directory in your terminal:
        ```bash
        cd D:\master documents\Smart Expense Tracker\server
        ```
    *   Run `npm start` to start the Node.js Express server. This will make the API available on `http://localhost:3000`:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    *   Navigate to the `client` directory in a *new* terminal window:
        ```bash
        cd D:\master documents\Smart Expense Tracker\client
        ```
    *   Run `npm run dev` to start the React development server. This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port):
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

3.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the Smart Expense Tracker in your web browser at the address provided by the frontend development server (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
