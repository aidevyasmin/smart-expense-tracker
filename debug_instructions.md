I've added error handling middleware to the backend server. This should provide more specific error messages to your browser's console when a 500 Internal Server Error occurs.

To help me diagnose the problem, **please restart both your frontend and backend servers**, and then:

1.  **Run your backend server again (`npm start` in the `server` directory).**
2.  **Run your frontend application again (`npm run dev` in the `client` directory).**
3.  **Attempt to use the application (e.g., add an expense).**
4.  **Copy and paste *any and all error messages* that appear in the terminal window where your backend server is running.** This is crucial for me to understand what exactly is causing the 500 error.
